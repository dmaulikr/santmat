The Sant Mat Lineages Chart is an effort to list various Inner Light
and Sound resources. It is a continuation of [the chart developed by
Erika Molnar](http://bit.ly/qz2tMT). her Yahoo ID was
[curious_yang](http://yhoo.it/oc2u9P). Her primary resource was David
C. Lane's book and website.

While David Lane strives for technical accuracy in his lineage charts,
I primarily use the publicly stated history of a group without
confirming/denying/questioning the authenticity of it. 

For data on recent changes to the chart, please see the
[ChangeLog](https://github.com/metaperl/santmat/blob/master/ChangeLog).
