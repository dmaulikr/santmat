"mind is not merely a function of the brain" - mind can recall things
prior to brain.  
"if senses are of the body, how could you see things in dream,
imagination" .. senses are independant of body.
how to find out? meditate until you are free of body. you will have
even more senses because the body only blocks sensations. astral body
lives 800-3000 years. mind/karma lives for 3 billion years. Therefore
one is reborn several thousand times with same mind/karma.

We have identified with outer cover. Via meditation, and some
practice, we can learn about our inner bodies. Our causal self is our
own mind. We can directly know what happened all of those various
times. 

We will find we have been creating our own problems by putting our
attention on what we clearly are not.
