Wht is the path to enlightenment, or, getting real knowledge? People
have searched for this path for a long time and the path is so
strange and so unpredictable, so unknown to the human mind that people
have been struggling to find the path and they are on the path and
they've not been able to know which side to go and this has been going
on for centuries and centuries all over the world.

What is this path and what is enlightenment? A man once came to the
door an Indian swami, an Indian yogi, and he knocked at the door. And
the Indian mystic said: "Who is there?" There was no answer. So the
man knocked again.  And the mystic said: "Who are you? Why don't you
answer?" There was no answer. There was another knock. The mystic got
angry and said: "Why don't you say who are you?" Then the man
answered. He said: "if I knew who I was, I wouldnt come to you for
enlightenment."
