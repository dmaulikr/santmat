# Text transcription

Wht is the path to enlightenment, or, getting real knowledge? People
have searched for this path for a long time and the path is so
strange and so unpredictable, so unknown to the human mind that people
have been struggling to find the path and they are on the path and
they've not been able to know which side to go and this has been going
on for centuries and centuries.
