Wht is the path to enlightenment, or, getting real knowledge? People
have searched for this path for a long time and the path is so
strange and so unpredictable, so unknown to the human mind that people
have been struggling to find the path and they are on the path and
they've not been able to know which side to go and this has been going
on for centuries and centuries all over the world.

What is this path and what is enlightenment? A man once came to the
door an Indian swami, an Indian yogi, and he knocked at the door. And
the Indian mystic said: "Who is there?" There was no answer. So the
man knocked again.  And the mystic said: "Who are you? Why don't you
answer?" There was no answer. There was another knock. The mystic got
angry and said: "Why don't you say who are you?" Then the man
answered. He said: "if I knew who I was, I wouldnt come to you for
enlightenment."

When we talk of enlightenment, we really talk of finding out who we
really are. If we can find out who we really are, it will answer all
the other subsidiary questions that we make sound so important and so
necessary in understanding spiritual enlightenment. 

Enlightenment is, when we have the light of knowledge. There is no
darkness, except the darkness of ignorance. What we call darkness
outside, is our lack of appreciation of the role of absence of light
as against the presence of light. That the absence of light is as
necessary to make the experience of light possible as the presence of
light. 

Therefore darkness and light must take place together in order for
each of them to be there. If one is taken away, the other goes along
automatically along with it. Therefore, this is not darkness. The
absence of light outside is not real darkness. The real darkness is
not to know why light and darkness exist. And therefore, the real
darkness is ignorance.
